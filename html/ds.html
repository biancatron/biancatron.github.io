              The Design System (DS) at Lovehoney was pieced together while the
              UX designers were actively working on projects. This led to
              disorganization, duplicated component builds, and inconsistency
              across the board and our projects. Anytime I found myself with
              some downtime, I chipped away at updating the DS.

            Lovehoney uses the Atomic Design methodology. This allows for
            consistency in all components; from atoms, to molecules, to
            organisms. Properly organizing and building-in flexibility between
            states and styling allowed one component to be used in numerous
            ways. With rules and restrictions set, anyone could correctly use
            these without needing to reference documentation.

            Improve components and organize the DS for quicker application.

            To achieve this, I’ll need to make components that are…

                Before updating the DS, there needed to be a strategy. As a
                team, we each found 3 examples of DSs that were appealing. We
                then shared what we found and the appeal. Once we knew what we
                were looking to achieve, I took on the responsibility of
                drafting our process to get to a completed DS.

                The primary audience was the UX designers, but we needed to make
                the DS accessible to developers, PMs, Creative, and the
                Storefront team. Knowing there was a range of skill sets that
                could benefit from using the DS, I began by writing out
                introductory documentation. This included defining a DS, Atomic
                Design, and UX principles.

              The color cards were doing more than providing the hex code for
              our brand colors. They also indicated how to stay in contrast
              compliance when using black or white font. But, I found the
              Creative or Storefront teams would often pair the primary brand
              color, a purple, with another brand color and fall out of
              compliance. So, I redesigned the color cards to include compliance
              information when pairing with the primary purple.

              The original 50 icons were not set up with any guidelines, rules,

              I began rebuilding the Lovehoney iconography by seeing how a
              complex icon could be rebuilt against a defined grid and keylines.
              <br /><br />
              This allowed me to rebuild all 50 icons, with a couple extras.
              These new icons had consistent brand colors, stroke width, and
              corner radii.

              The next challenge was recreating the Input field component.
              Originally, this component was set up with several different
              states within the same component as hidden layers. Although there
              were variants, the component was not flexible and, honestly, a bit
              messy. I was tasked by the team to make this as a single, flexible
              component that could support different states, a range of nested
              instances, and varying amounts of fields.
              <br /><br />
              ​This rebuild required a lot of planning and trial and error. I
              knew I’d need to make variants based on the component states
              (active, inactive, error), but there were a lot of questions I
              could only figure out by getting into the build and seeing what
              would happen!

              While the holidays approached, I took the opportunity to learn

              they returned from their break. The product tile was an exciting
              piece as it allowed me to prepare it for variables in its

          <p class="bg-description">
            The biggest and most consistent obstacle I ran into when updating
            the DS was that many components were not originally built with
            Atomic Design in mind. This led me to go back and forth between
            components to ensure larger components were being built with the
            flexibility of a well made smaller component.
            <br /><br />
            This was a great project to help communication and build a stronger
            relationship with the team. Being able to teach variables helped me
            learn the concept better. Cleaning up components and teaching the
            team better ways to construct them helped us all make more
            consistent designs in less time. As any DS, it still has a ways to
            go and may find itself evolving into something new entirely.
