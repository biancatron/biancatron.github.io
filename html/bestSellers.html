              The majority of adult product shoppers lack knowledge about
              product variety and function. This leads many of Lovehoney’s

              The best sellers page is one of the higher performing pages on the

              Using both site and comparative analyses to identify where changes
              could be beneficial, I presented multiple page layouts that could
              be easily supported by Amplience, our CMS. Based on the feedback,
              I mocked up page updates for all 5 Best Seller pages and A/B
              testing began. After one month, most changes were not beneficial;
              however, we were able to add an evergreen "See more" CTA that
              accounted for 53.4% of taps on mobile and 26.2% on desktop.

                First, I looked into what was working and what areas could use

                I also wanted to research layouts that were proven successful. I
                used Baymard to find sites that have well performing best seller

                Challenges & Solutions

                The North America team did not have its own budget for
                conducting user testing or development support. Any design
                updates would need to be supported by the components available
                in Amplience, the content support tool. It would also need to be
                maintained by the Storefront team alone. This created a lot of
                limitations.
                <br /><br />
                The biggest challenge was the “See more” CTA. The option for a
                row with a single CTA button had not been done before. But with
                a little HTML hacking, I figured out a way to achieve it.

                When I shared these with the North America team, Variant C was
                the winning and achievable design. However, we realized that
                along with the main Best Sellers landing page, the additional
                category pages needed to be updated.
                <br /><br />
                Another challenge that presented was the lack of guides. The
                pill buttons needed rules for color combinations between the
                text, pill button, and the pill’s image. A writing style guide
                was also needed to define the use of hyphens and capitalization
                in products and phrases, like Best Sellers vs best-selling. As I
                was designing the new layouts, I determined the rules for these.

              Once I had set up the Storefront team with mockups for all 5 best

              sites. The changes were on site for one month before we evaluated.
              When the time came, I put together our results from Google

              Overall, the changes were unfortunately unfavorable. Looking at US
              performance, 4 out of 5 pages decreased in page value and
              conversions. But there was a ray of light! The “See more” CTA was
              highly engaged with, accounting for 53.4% of taps on mobile and
              26.2% on desktop. The success of this button led it to become a
              standard piece on the Best Seller pages.

              Although the test overall was not positive, it pushed valuable
              changes. Looking at the journey as a whole reminded us to make
              updates to all the pages to keep users in a consistent flow.
              Testing multiple changes was risky, but with multiple tools for
              analysis, we were able to discover a success in the negative
              results.
